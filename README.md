# Form Generator

Hello! This is a form generator component that accepts a structured schema and builds a form based on the schema.

This is still a work in progress but we would love to have your help! (Also, we appreciate your help in fixing the existing issues!)

We use Kongponents to implement this component. [View Docs](https://alpha--kongponents.netlify.app/)

## TODOs

- [x] Support `text` (KInput)
- [ ] Support `number` (KInput)
- [ ] Support `select` (KSelect)
- [ ] Support `array` (This will be a component allows us to create a list of a specific field mentioned above)
